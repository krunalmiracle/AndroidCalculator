#Android Calculator
Author of the program is Krunal Badsiwal with Academic terms of condition from UPC.
Uses a personal Expression parsing script to determine the result specified in Calculator Interface.
The Expression Interface is used to determine the validity of Mathemathical Input from the user and 
build a expression of valid arithmethic values based on the priority and properties of each successing operator.
This program is able to parse any second order operators and some specific third operators. The third order operator have
some bugs such as no recursive calculation possible till of yet,but does allow recurrsive operations below third degree. 
Handeled user UX properly with still bugs due to uder stupidity.
